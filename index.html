					<h2> Who are we? </h2>
					<!--<h3>Welcome</h3>-->
					<p>As a local nonprofit organization, our mission is to help people contest and win appeals on parking violations in the city of Chicago. We’re currently focusing on the 24th ward due to some alarming statistics that can be found <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/chicago-tickets/ward/24" target=_blank>here</a> and down below. </p>

			<h3 >Statistics</h3>
			<!--<p>The 24th ward has collected over 48 million dollars of debt over the course of 22 years, and this is due to the fact that less than half of the tickets issued are being paid.There’s also the fact that 46% of vehicle users that are being issued these tickets are at risk of losing their vehicle or license, that’s only a little less than half! We also decided to target your specific ward because only 9% of the tickets are being contested, and although that isn’t much, the people who do contest have a success rate of 67%.
